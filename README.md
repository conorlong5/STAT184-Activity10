# STAT184-Activity10
This is the repo for the assignment Activity 10 in STAT 184.

Some notes:
- Due to using kableExtra, there seems to be an issue with knitting using two outputs simultaneously. I could not find a fix, so I knitted the pdf and html separately.
- In the knitted PDF, there is an issue with my table positioning. The HTML file should be the finished result. However, the PDF puts the diamond table above the
  header and also the graph, which it shouldn't. I could not find a fix for this so I left it as is.
